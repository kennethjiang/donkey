# Controller Parts

## Local Web Controller

The default controller to drive the car with your phone or browser. This has a web live preview of camera. Control options include:

1. A virtual joystick
2. The tilt, when using a mobile device with supported accelerometer
3. A physical joystick using the web adapter. Support varies per browser, os, and joystick combination.


## Physical Joystick Controller

The default web controller may be replaced with a one line change to use a physical joystick part for input. This uses the os device /dev/input/js0 by default. In theory, any joystick device that the os mounts like this can be used. In practice, the behavior will change depending on the model of joystick ( Sony, or knockoff ), or XBox controller and the bluetooth driver used to support it. The default code has been written and tested with a [Sony brand PS3 Sixaxis controller](https://www.amazon.com/Dualshock-Wireless-Controller-Charcoal-playstation-3). Other controllers may work, but will require alternative bluetooth installs, and tweaks to the software for correct axis and buttons.

These can be used plugged in with a usb cable - but the default code and os driver has a bug polling this configuration. It's been much more stable, and convenient, to setup bluetooth for a wireless, responsive control.

### Change to manage.py

comment out the line:
```
#ctr = dk.parts.LocalWebController()
```
and enable the line:
```
ctr = dk.parts.JoystickPilot()
```

This disables the live preview of the camera and the web page features.

### Bluetooth Setup

Follow [this guide](https://pythonhosted.org/triangula/sixaxis.html). You can ignore steps past the 'Accessing the SixAxis from Python' section.

Be sure to reboot after changing user group.

To test that the Bluetooth PS3 remote is working, verify that /dev/input/js0 exists.

```bash
ls /dev/input/js0
```

### Charging PS3 Sixaxis Joystick

For some reason, they don't like to charge in a powered usb port that doesn't have an active bluetooth control and os driver. So a phone type usb charger won't work. Try a powered linux or mac laptop usb port. You should see the lights blink after plugging in and hitting center PS logo.

After charging, you will need to plug-in the controller again to the Pi, hit the PS logo, then unplug to pair again.

### New Battery for PS3 Sixaxis Joystick

Sometimes these controllers can be quite old. Here's a link to a [new battery](http://a.co/5k1lbns). Be careful when taking off the cover. Remove 5 screws. There's a tab on the top half between the hand grips. You'll want to split/open it from the front and try pulling the bottom forward as you do. Or you'll break the tab off as I did.
